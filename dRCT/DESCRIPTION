Title: Design-Based Covariate Adjustment for the Average Treatment Effect
Version: 1.0.0
Description: Covariate-adjusted estimators of the average treatment effect in Bernoulli, pair, and paired cluster randomized experiments. Given a set of experimental data, uses a prediction algorithm to impute the potential outcomes for each observation, which are then used to estimate the average treatment effect.
